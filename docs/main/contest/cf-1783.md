## D

You are given list $a$ of $n$ integers.

You have to perform $n-2$ operations in sequence. The $i$-th operation is one of:
- $a_i \leftarrow a_i - a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i+2} \leftarrow a_{i+2} + a_{i+1}$
- $a_i \leftarrow a_i + a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i+2} \leftarrow a_{i+2} - a_{i+1}$

In other words, for $i = 1$ to $n-2$ (in order), $a_{i+1}$ should be added to one of the neighbors
and subtracted from the other.

Find number of distinct arrays that can be obtained (modulo $10^9 + 7$)

Constraints:
- $1 \le n \le 300$
- $1 \le a_i \le 300$

**Solution**

Let $f(i, x)$ be number of distinct arrays of length $i$
with last element as $x$ after performing operations
$1, 2, \ldots, i-2$.

Let $X$ be the set of possible values of $x$ (which
will be in range $[-M \cdot n, M \cdot n]$ where $M$ is maximum
possible $a_i$)

We can define a base case for $i = 0$ as
- $f(2, a_2) = 1$ since if we perform $0$ operations, we have $[a_1, a_2]$.
- $f(2, x) = 0$ if $x \neq a_2$

Now, for some $(i, x)$ we
have $f(i, x)$ distinct arrays of form $[\ldots, z, x]$. In the next operation these can further yield:
- $[\ldots, z - x, x, a_{i+1} + x]$
- $[\ldots, z + x, x, a_{i+1} - x]$

Assume that initially $f(i+1, y) = 0$ $\forall$ $y \in X$ and
we are computing $f(i+1, y)$ assuming that $f(i, x)$ is computed.
- Let $x_1 = a_{i+1} + x$. Do $f(i+1, x_1) \leftarrow f(i+1, x_1) + f(i,x)$
- Let $x_2 = a_{i+1} - x$. Do $f(i+1, x_2) \leftarrow f(i+1, x_2) + f(i,x)$

We will now show that $f(i+1, y)$ will always have distinct arrays.
Notice that only $f(i, a_i - y)$ and $f(i, y - a_i)$ contribute to value of $f(i+1, y)$.
Obviously there is no intersection between arrays covered by both of these (as they end with different values).
There is an exception when $a_i = y$ because in that case $f(i, a_i - y) = f(i, y - a_i) = 0$ hence 
we need to add only once.

Also, the operation on element $i-1$ will not affect the
distinct nature of arrays covered by $f(i, a_i - y)$ and
$f(i, y - a_i)$ because:
- Last element always remains same (i.e., $a_i - y$ or $y - a_i$)
  hence both sets can never have an intersection.
- Within a set, we are adding same value to second last element,
  thus the arrays will be still pairwise distinct.

Time complexity: $O(n^2 M)$ where $M$ is maximum possible $a_i$.
